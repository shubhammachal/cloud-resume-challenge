          Outside of work, I stay deeply engaged with technology by following AI research, reading technical discussions on platforms like Reddit, and listening to industry podcasts. This helps me stay current with new tools, frameworks, and architectural patterns. I also enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, running, tennis, and cricket, along with occasional downtime watching thriller movies and exploring global music.
