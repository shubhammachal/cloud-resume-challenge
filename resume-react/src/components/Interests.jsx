        <p>
          In addition to being a Software Engineer, I love spending time outdoors, whether it's hiking, 
          running, playing tennis and cricket, or exploring new places.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-0">
          When indoors, I enjoy watching thriller movies and discovering music in various languages. 
          I also dedicate a significant portion of my free time to exploring the latest advancements 
          in technology, particularly in the field of AI.
